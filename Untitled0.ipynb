            "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of living beings, primarily of humans. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs.\n",
            "\n",
            "AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), interacting via human speech (such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (such as chess and Go).\n",
            "\n",
            "Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence.[2] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[3] The field went through multiple cycles of optimism,[4][5] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.[6][7] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,[8] and after 2017 with the transformer architecture. This led to the AI spring of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.\n",
            "\n",
            "The growing use of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is influencing a societal and economic shift towards increased automation, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of AI systems into various economic sectors and areas of life, impacting job markets, healthcare, government, industry, and education. This raises questions about the ethical implications and risks of AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n",
            "\n",
            "The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence (the ability to complete any task performable by a human) is among the field's long-term goals.[11]\n",
            "\n",
            "To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and other fields.[12]\n",

            "\n",
            "Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.[15] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\n",

Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.\n",
            "\n",

A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[33] In automated decision making, the agent has preferences – there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[34]\n",

Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.

            "Defining artificial intelligence\n",
            "\n",
            "Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[277] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people[z] but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that AI must be defined in terms of \"acting\" and not \"thinking\". However, they are critical that the test compares machines to people. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'\" AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".\n",
            "\n",
            "McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.\" Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly defines it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another definition has been adopted by Google,[284] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\n",

            "Evaluating approaches to AI\n",
            "\n",
            "No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow (see below). Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Symbolic AI and its limits\n",
            "\n",
            "Symbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\") simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[287]\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[288] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[289] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16]\n",
            "\n",
            "The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\n",

            "\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[293] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\n",

Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\n",

General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\n",

            "The philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\n",

The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). Human information processing is easy to explain, however, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.\n",

Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.\n",

            "In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[308] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.[309][310]\n",

speech (such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (such as chess and Go).', 'Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence.', '[2] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.', '[3] The field went through multiple cycles of optimism,[4][5] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.', '[6][7] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,[8] and after 2017 with the transformer architecture.', 'This led to the AI spring of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.', 'The growing use of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is influencing a societal and economic shift towards increased automation, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of AI systems into various economic sectors and areas of life,

preferences – there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid.', 'The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\")

each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\").', 'It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.', \"[36]\\n\\nIn some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved.\", 'These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning) or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.', '[37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.', '[38] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain what the outcome will be.', 'A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action.', 'A policy associates a decision with each possible state.', 'The policy could be calculated (e.g.', 'by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.', '[39]\\n\\nGame theory describes rational

local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function.', 'Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks.',

(inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).', 'Logic\\n\\nFormal Logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.', '[77] Formal logic comes in two main

'[244][245]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity.', 'The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church–Turing thesis.', 'This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".', '[q][248]\\n\\nAlan Turing was thinking about machine intelligence at least as early as 1941, when he circulated a paper on machine intelligence which could be the earliest paper in the field of AI – though it is now lost.', '[2] The first available paper generally recognized as \"AI\" was McCullouch and Pitts design for Turing-complete \"artificial neurons\" in 1943 – the first mathematical model of a neural network.', \"The paper was influenced by Turing's earlier paper 'On Computable Numbers' from 1936 using similar two-state boolean 'neurons', but was the first to apply it to neuronal function.\", \"[2]\\n\\nThe term 'machine intelligence' was used by Alan Turing during his life which was later often referred to as 'artificial intelligence' after his death in 1954.\", \"In 1950 Turing published the best known of his papers 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', the paper introduced his concept of what is now known as the Turing test to the general public.\", \"Then followed three radio broadcasts on AI by Turing, the lectures: 'Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory', 'Can Digital Computers Think'?\", \"and the panel discussion 'Can Automatic Calculating Machines be Said to Think'.\", 'By 1956 computer intelligence had been actively pursued for more than a decade in Britain; the earliest AI programmes were written there in 1951–1952.', '[2]\\n\\nIn 1951, using a Ferranti Mark 1 computer of the University of Manchester, checkers and chess programs were wrote where you could play against the computer.', '[250] The field of American AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.', '[r][3] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.', '[s] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[t] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.', '[u][4] Artificial Intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and US Universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.', '[2]\\n\\nThey had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.', '[v] Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects.', \"Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.\", 'The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.', '[6]\\n\\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[257] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts.', 'By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars.', \"At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.\", '[5] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.', '[7]\\n\\nMany researchers began to doubt that the current practices would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition.', 'A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches.', 'Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.', '[w] Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.', '[85] But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.', '[265] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.', 'AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems.', 'This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).', '[267] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\".', '[268]\\n\\nSeveral academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines.', 'Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.', '[11]\\n\\nDeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.', '[8] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.', \"[x] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[270] graphics processing units, cloud computing ) and access to large amounts of data[272] (including curated datasets, such as ImageNet).\", \"Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.\", '[y] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019, and WIPO reported that AI was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents.', '[273] According to \\'AI Impacts\\', about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the US alone and about 20% of new US Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\"; about 800,000 \"AI\"-related US job openings existed in 2022.', 'The large majority of the advances have occurred within the United States, with its companies, universities, and research labs leading artificial intelligence research.', 'In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues.', 'The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.', 'Philosophy\\n\\nDefining artificial intelligence\\n\\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question \\'can machines think\\'?\"', 'He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".', 'He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.', '[277] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\".', 'Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people[z] but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\"\\n\\nRussell and Norvig agree with Turing that AI must be defined in terms of \"acting\" and not \"thinking\".', 'However, they are critical that the test compares machines to people.', '\"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making \\'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\\'\"', 'AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".', 'McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.\"', 'Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly defines it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\".', 'These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.', 'Another definition has been adopted by Google,[284] a major practitioner in the field of AI.', 'This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.', 'Evaluating approaches to AI\\n\\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.', '[aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\").', 'This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow (see below).', 'Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.', 'Symbolic AI and its limits\\n\\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\") simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics.', 'They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests.', 'In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.', '\"[287]\\n\\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning.', 'Moravec\\'s paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.', '[288] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.', '[289] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.', '[ab][16]\\n\\nThe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias.', 'Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision.', 'The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.', 'Neat vs. scruffy\\n\\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks).', '\"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems.', 'Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work.', 'This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[293] but eventually was seen as irrelevant.', 'Modern AI has elements of both.', 'Soft vs. hard computing\\n\\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.', '[15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation.', 'Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.', \"Narrow vs. general AI\\n\\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.\", 'General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions.', 'The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.', 'Machine consciousness, sentience and mind\\n\\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do.', 'This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior.', 'Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence.', 'Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"', 'However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind.', 'It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.', 'Consciousness\\n\\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.', 'The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior.', \"The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion).\", 'Human information processing is easy to explain, however, human subjective experience is difficult to explain.', 'For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.', 'Computationalism and functionalism\\n\\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.', 'Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem.', 'This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.', 'Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.', '\"[ac] Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.', '[303]\\n\\nAI welfare and rights\\n\\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.', '[304] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.', '[305][306] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.', '[305] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.', '[307]\\n\\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems.', 'Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.', '[308] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios.', 'They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.', '[309][310]\\n\\nProgress in AI increased interest in the topic.', 'Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny.', 'They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.', '[306][305]\\n\\nFuture\\n\\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\\n\\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.', 'If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself.', 'The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J.', 'Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".', '[311]\\n\\nHowever, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.', 'Transhumanism\\n\\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick, and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either.', 'This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.', '[313]\\n\\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler\\'s \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.', '[314]\\n\\nIn fiction\\n\\nThe word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R., the title standing for \"Rossum\\'s Universal Robots\".', 'Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[315] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.', \"A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters.\", \"This includes such works as Arthur C.
